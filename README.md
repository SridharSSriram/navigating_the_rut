# navigating the rut

**this is entirely designed for the members of the 2018-2019 5SE floor**

hopefully, this answers most of your questions.

## navigating this app:

:key: instructions for when you're locked out!
<br>
:heart: this is for wellness services and any other help links
<br>
:fork_and_knife: food options on Easton Avenue
<br>
:bell: this is for floor notifications
<br>

## future fixes:

* when users click "x" on each modal window or click outside of modal windows, collapse the open "accordion" texts

## for the nerds:

* this app was built in ReactJS with the help of [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

* shoutout to [this page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/) for helping me serve this react app through github pages
